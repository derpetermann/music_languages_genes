# Data

We retrieve the ASJP version 19 database [@ASJP19] from \url{https://zenodo.org/record/3843469#.YCDeVC1Q0UE} and load the data relevant for the area. There are many missing values, but a closer inspection of their distribution suggests a break between concepts attested in at least 46 (74%) doculects^[different wordlists, dialects, sociolects, or any other varieties [@Goodetal2013Languoid].] vs. concepts attested in only 16 (25%) or fewer doculects. We retain only those with at least 46 attestation. This corresponds to the 40 best-coverage concepts chosen by [@Jager2018Global-scale] and to the ASJP core set (marked by an asterisks in the ASJP `Name` field).

We chose the ASJP data because it covers all 14 languages for which we have matching data in grammar, phonology, music, and genetics. This is not the case for alternatives like \url{http://northeuralex.org} [@Dellertetal2020NorthEuraLex] that would include larger vocabularies (although many of which are recent borrowings or words with special trade histories like the word for tea').

```{r data}
asjp_register <- read_csv('asjp19-languages.csv') %>% 
  select(ID, Glottocode, Glottolog_Name, ISO639P3code) %>% 
  distinct()
asjp_concepts <- read_csv("asjp19-parameters.csv")
asjp_data_all <- read_csv('asjp19-forms.csv') %>%
  inner_join(asjp_register[, c("ID","Glottocode","Glottolog_Name", "ISO639P3code")],
             by = c("Language_ID" = "ID")) %>%
  filter(Glottocode %in% c(
    "kore1280", "nucl1643", "ainu1240",
    "kory1246", "chuk1273", "yaku1245",
    "even1260", "sout2750", "even1259",
    "mong1330", # This is a different variety of Buriat; ASJP does not have buri1258
    "kala1399", "selk1253",
    "ngan1291", "gily1242"
    )) %>% 
  inner_join(asjp_concepts, by = c("Parameter_ID"= "ID"))

best_concepts <- group_by(asjp_data_all, Concepticon_Gloss) %>% 
  summarise(n=n_distinct(Language_ID)) %>% 
  filter(n >= 46) %>% 
  pull(Concepticon_Gloss)

all(subset(asjp_concepts, grepl("*", Name, fixed = T))$Concepticon_Gloss %in% best_concepts)

asjp_data <- filter(asjp_data_all, Concepticon_Gloss %in% best_concepts)

# PMI distances

We measure lexical distances on the basis of alignments that are weighted by sound correspondence probabilities estimated by pointwise mutual information (PMI). PMI-weighted distances correspond better to distances in recognized phylogenies than other available methods of estimating lexical distances [@Jager2018Global-scale; @Jager2013Phylogenetic]. This suggests that they can also uncover distances that derive from historical process beyond individual language families, and this is why we use them for the main study.^[The gold standard for capturing phylogenetic relations stills relies on cognacy judgments that are careful screened and edited by experts [@Listetal2017The-Potential]. But cognacy judgments are defined only *within* families, and families need to be established first on independent grounds [@Nichols1996The-Comparative]] We computed PMI-weighted distances using Gerhard JÃ¤ger's Python script available from \url{https://osf.io/rbdwq/}. For this purpose, the data need to be reshaped into a wide format:

```{r pmi-preprocessing}
asjp_data_wide <- asjp_data %>% 
  select(Concepticon_Gloss, Language_ID, Glottocode, ISO639P3code, Form) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=Concepticon_Gloss,
              values_from=Form,
              # collect multiple values when they exist
              values_fn = function(x) paste(x, collapse = ", ")
  ) %>% 
  # some data massage for the python code...
  mutate_all(function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "", x)) %>% 
  column_to_rownames("Language_ID")
```

We then process the data in Python, calling in the pre-computed PMI scores and gap penalties from \url{https://osf.io/rbdwq/}. These scores and penalties are estimated on the global ASJP dataset (taking several days of computation), and so we do not re-compute them here.

results = concatenate([return_dict[i] for i in range(ncores)])

```

Next, we reshape the output into a distance matrix and, from that, into a table of pairwise distances, adding back in Glottocodes and language names:

```{r pmi-postprocessing}
asjpPMI.dist <- structure(py$results, # python output
                Size = length(py$taxa), # python output
                Labels = py$taxa,
                Diag = F,
                Upper = F,
                method = "user",
                class = "dist")

# all language pairs
lg_pairs <- combn(attr(asjpPMI.dist, "Labels"), 2, simplify = FALSE)

asjpPMI.df <- data.frame(Language.x = sapply(lg_pairs, "[[", 1),
                         Language.y = sapply(lg_pairs, "[[", 2),
                          py$results) %>% 
  inner_join(asjp_register, by = c("Language.x" = "ID")) %>% 
  inner_join(asjp_register, by = c("Language.y" = "ID"))
```

When there are several doculects per language, we take the mean distances.

```{r pmi-aggregation}
asjpPMI_aggregated.df <- asjpPMI.df %>% 
  # we don't use group_by directly for aggregating per language, but impose order on
  # how the pairs are coded because that makes it easier to push the pairs into a 
  # `dist` object later:
  mutate(pairs = paste0(Glottocode.x, "-", Glottocode.y)) %>%
  mutate(ordered_pairs = unname(sapply(pairs, 
                                       function(s) paste0(sort(strsplit(s[1], '-')[[1]]),
                                                          collapse = '-')))) %>%
  group_by(ordered_pairs) %>%
  # we take the minimal distance in each pair of languages:
  summarise(PMIDistance = mean(py.results),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  # undo the pasting:
  separate(ordered_pairs, c("Glottocode.x", "Glottocode.y")) %>%
  # remove self-matches, setting them to be 0:
  filter(Glottocode.x != Glottocode.y) %>% 
  # add language names back in:
  inner_join(unique(asjp_register[,c('Glottocode', 'Glottolog_Name')]), 
             by = c("Glottocode.x" = "Glottocode")) %>%
  inner_join(unique(asjp_register[,c('Glottocode', 'Glottolog_Name')]), 
             by = c("Glottocode.y" = "Glottocode"))
```

We adapt the names in the main paper and write to `.nex` and `.csv` files for input into the main analyses (Supprting Information 1). The distancs are tabulated in Table 1 and visualized as a Neighbornet in Figure 1, with colors coding language relationships (blue: Tungusic; green: Chukotko-Kamchatkan; red: Uralic) shows a Neighbornet [@Husonetal2006Application] representation.

```{r pmi-distance-matrices}

# LDND distances

We replicate the analysis with the older and more commonly used twice-normalized Levenshtein distances, known as "LDND" [@Holmanetal2008Advances; see @Greenhill2011 for critical discussion]. For efficiency, we reimplemented the computations here.^[We are grateful to Taras Zakharko for help with this.] When there are multiple entries for a concept per doculect, we pick again the mean distance (like we did when computing the PMI-weighted distances).

Since LDND distances are not weighted by sound classes, we compare strings not in terms of the abstract (reduced) ASJP sound class representations, but in terms of the segmented phonological representations available in ASJP's `Segments` field. We recode these representations as character vectors and re-implement a Levenshtein distance measure that operates over these vectors. This procedure ensures that complex segments like /kh/ (aspirated k) are treated as single units that can be deleted, inserted or replaced, e.g. it allows sound changes like /kh/ â /x/ as the single step ("lenition") that it is.

```{r ldnd-computation, cache = T}

asjpLDND.df <-
  # get all language pairs and set up a table with one pair per row
  combn(sort(unique(asjp_data$Glottocode)), 2, simplify = FALSE) %>%
  map_dfr(~ tibble(Glottocode.x = .[[1]], Glottocode.y = .[[2]])) %>%
  # process by pair in parallel
  future_pmap_dfr(function(Glottocode.x, Glottocode.y) {

    # get wordlists for both languages
    # Test example: Glottocode.x <- "ainu1240"; Glottocode.y = 'chuk1273'
    wordlist.x <- filter(asjp_data, Glottocode == Glottocode.x)
    wordlist.y <- filter(asjp_data, Glottocode == Glottocode.y)

    # build a list of all word pairs; for the second normalization below
    # we need both pairs of forms for the same concept and 
    # pairs of forms for different concepts
    ii <- expand_grid(
      x = seq_len(nrow(wordlist.x)),
      y = seq_len(nrow(wordlist.y))
    )
    wordpairs <- tibble(
      slice(wordlist.x, ii$x) %>% rename_with(~ str_c(., ".x")),
      slice(wordlist.y, ii$y) %>% rename_with(~ str_c(., ".y"))
    )
    # compute the distances for each pair of forms
    wordpairs <- wordpairs %>%
      mutate(
        # parsing the segmented representations:
        seg_seq.x = str_split(Segments.x, " +"),
        seg_seq.y = str_split(Segments.y, " +"),
        seg_length.x = map_int(seg_seq.x, length),
        seg_length.y = map_int(seg_seq.y, length)
      ) %>%
      mutate(
        # segment-based Levenshtein distance:
        LD = map2_int(seg_seq.x, seg_seq.y, levenshtein_distance),
        # first normalization, by string length:
        LDN = LD/pmax(seg_length.x, seg_length.y)
      ) %>%
      # for each concept pair, pick the mean distance between forms: 
      group_by(Concepticon_Gloss.x, Concepticon_Gloss.y) %>%
      summarize(
        meanLDN = mean(LDN),
        .groups = "drop"
      )

     # aggregate and compute LDND from LDN (second normalization):
    tibble(
      # header
      Glottocode.x = Glottocode.x,
      Glottocode.y = Glottocode.y,
      # divide the mean distance between forms for the same concept
      # by the mean distance between forms for different concepts:
      wordpairs %>%
      summarize(
        LDND = mean(meanLDN[Concepticon_Gloss.x == Concepticon_Gloss.y])/
               mean(meanLDN[Concepticon_Gloss.x != Concepticon_Gloss.y])
      )
    )
  }, .options = furrr_options(scheduling = Inf))
```

We add language names and reshape into distance matrix. Table 2 summarizes the full distance matrix and Figure 2 shows a Neighbornet [@Husonetal2006Application] representation.
